            recommend. We are meticulous about keeping ourselves current on the
            finest destinations Africa has to offer. Furthermore, we are
            committed to the conservation of Africaâ€™s natural and cultural
            resources and economic upliftment. This is reflected in part by our
            choice of local suppliers, lodges and hotels and also through our
            own direct support of important programs and initiatives.
