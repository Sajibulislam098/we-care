            Live Africa draws on the unique backgrounds of its team, with
            decades of combined experience working with discerning travelers to
            design and coordinate unforgettable safaris to Africa. We have
            personally visited and approved all of the destinations we
            recommend. We are meticulous about keeping ourselves current on the
            finest destinations Africa has to offer. Furthermore, we are
            committed to the conservation of Africa’s natural and cultural
            resources and economic upliftment. This is reflected in part by our
            choice of local suppliers, lodges and hotels and also through our
            own direct support of important programs and initiatives.
